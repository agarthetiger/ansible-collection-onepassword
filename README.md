# Ansible Collection for 1Password

This Ansible Collection contains a single inventory plugin to use [1Password](https://1password.com/) as a dynamic inventory source for Ansible.

See the collection's [Readme](agarthetiger/onepassword/README.md) for full details, because this is the file used by Ansible Galaxy.
